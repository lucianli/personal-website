                Hi, I'm Lucian. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UCLA, and 
                am looking for opportunities in Software Development with interest and experience 
                in front-end and full-stack development. I am passionate about blending 
                design and development, and hope to make a meaningful impact on the world around me 
                by creating seamless and user-centric digital experiences.
